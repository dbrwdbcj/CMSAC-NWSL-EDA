## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plotly_test <- nwsl_team_stats |> 
  select(TeamName = team_name,
         PossPct = possession_pct,
         GoalDiff = goal_differential,
         Season = season) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=PossPct, y=GoalDiff, color=Season, 
             text = paste( "",TeamName, "<br>", "Season:", Season, 
                           "<br>", "Possession%:", PossPct, "<br>", 
                           "Goal Differential:", GoalDiff)))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title='Does Controlling the Ball Lead to Success?',
    subtitle = "Goal Differential vs. Possession Percentage"
  )+
  xlab("Possession Percentage")+
  ylab("Goal Differential")+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=PossPct, y=GoalDiff, 
                            text = paste("", "Possession%:", 
                                         round(after_stat(x), 2), "<br>", 
                "Goal Differential:", round(after_stat(y), 2))), method="lm", 
              color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE)+
  theme_solarized()
  #   theme(
  #   plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face="bold")
  # )+
  # theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#6794a7"))+
  # theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffeabd", color = "#ffeabd"))

ggplotly(plotly_test, tooltip = "text")
```
