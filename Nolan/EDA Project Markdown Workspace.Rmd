## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(viridis)
plotly_test <- nwsl_team_stats |> 
  select(TeamName = team_name,
         PossPct = possession_pct,
         GoalDiff = goal_differential,
         Season = season) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=PossPct, y=GoalDiff, color=Season, 
             text = paste( "",TeamName, "<br>", "Season:", Season, 
                           "<br>", "Possession%:", PossPct, "<br>", 
                           "Goal Differential:", GoalDiff)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.6, size = 2)+
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=FALSE)+

                            text = paste("", "Possession%:", 
                                         round(after_stat(x), 2), "<br>", 
                "Goal Differential:", round(after_stat(y), 2))), method="lm", 
              color="gray20", inherit.aes = FALSE)+

    axis.title = element_text(family="Arial", size=12),
    axis.text = element_text(family="Arial", size=12),
    legend.title = element_text(family = "Arial", size = 10),  
    legend.text = element_text(family = "Arial", size = 8),
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "gray", fill = NA, linewidth = .5)
